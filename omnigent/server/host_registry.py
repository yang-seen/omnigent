"""In-memory registry of live host WebSocket connections.

Each server replica maintains one :class:`HostRegistry` tracking
hosts with active WebSocket tunnels on this replica. The persistent
``hosts`` DB table (queried by ``HostStore``) is the cross-replica
source of truth for which hosts exist; this registry only tracks
which hosts are live *here*.

Simpler than :class:`TunnelRegistry` because the host tunnel
carries only control frames (launch/stop runner), not HTTP
request/response traffic. No per-request reassembly queues needed.
