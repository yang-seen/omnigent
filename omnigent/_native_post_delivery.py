"""Delivery-ambiguity classification and shared retry loop for native-forwarder
event POSTs.

The claude-native, codex-native, and antigravity-native forwarders mirror
transcript items into AP as ``external_conversation_item`` POSTs. The server
persists those with a random primary key and does NOT dedupe them — producers
are responsible for not re-posting items they have already sent. That makes a
blind retry after a failed POST unsafe: if the server committed the item and
published ``session.input.consumed`` but the response was lost, a retry appends
a second copy and the web UI renders a duplicate bubble. The native tmux pane
is unaffected, which is why the duplicate is web-only.

:func:`post_may_have_been_delivered` is the shared classifier all forwarders
use to decide whether a failed POST is safe to retry.

:func:`post_session_event_with_retry` is the shared retry loop extracted from
the codex/antigravity forwarders so a single implementation is maintained.
