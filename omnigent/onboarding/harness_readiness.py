"""Harness readiness checks used by the host daemon.

The daemon reports a per-harness readiness map in its hello frame (so the
web agent picker can warn) and re-checks the session's harness before
spawning a runner (so an unconfigured launch fails with a clear,
actionable error instead of dying inside the executor).

"Configured" here is deliberately narrow: the **only** thing the daemon
can reliably determine locally is whether a harness's wrapped CLI binary
is on ``PATH``. That gates the native CLI harnesses (Claude Code / Codex
via ``claude`` / ``codex``) and ``pi`` — the common "I picked Claude Code
but never ran ``omnigent setup`` to install it" case.

In-process SDK harnesses (``claude-sdk``, ``openai-agents``) run without
any CLI and resolve their model credentials at runtime from sources the
daemon cannot enumerate — environment API keys, a Databricks profile /
gateway, or the spec's ``executor.auth`` with ``${ENV}`` expansion. The
daemon has no way to know whether those will resolve, so it never gates
them (a genuine auth failure surfaces at the first turn via the
executor's own error). Unknown harnesses fail open for the same reason.
This keeps the check free of false negatives that would block a launch
that would actually work.
