// Surfaces "a session needs your attention" as OS notifications and a
// dock/taskbar badge. Rides the existing conversations poll (no new backend
// signal).
//
// Notifications fire on two "attention" TRANSITIONS, diffed against the
// previous snapshot:
//   * a turn finishing — status `running` -> `idle`/`failed`
//   * a new elicitation — `pending_elicitations_count` increased (the agent
//     is asking the user for input)
//
// The dock badge is NOT transition-based: it's recomputed from the full
// conversation list every tick using the same persistent definition as the
// sidebar — sessions with unseen activity (`isConversationUnseen`, backed by
// the localStorage last-seen baseline) plus sessions awaiting input (pending
// elicitations). That keeps it correct across reloads and counts sessions
// that finished while the app was closed. A session is suppressed only while
// the user is actively viewing it: the window is focused AND it's the open
// conversation. Notifications follow the same rule — anything that needs
// attention notifies, except the conversation you're actively looking at.
//
// Notifications are on by default — there's no settings toggle. In a plain
// browser the Web Notifications API still requires a permission grant, so we
// request it once, lazily, off the first genuine user gesture (prompting on
// load gets downgraded to Chrome's "quiet UI" and silently never appears).
// Granting permission is the opt-in; denying it is respected and never
// re-prompted. Under the Electron desktop shell the OS notification path
// manages permission, so that gate doesn't apply.
