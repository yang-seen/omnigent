 * - `timestamp`: monotonic-ish timestamp (seconds) when the block was created.

 *   Empty string for synthetic blocks not associated with a server
 *   response yet (e.g. an optimistic user-message block before

 * - `itemId`: server-assigned item id this block originated from. Set

 *   native tools, finalized assistant messages) and on every block
 *   produced by `itemsToBlocks` (historical hydration). `null` for
 *   ephemeral blocks (text/reasoning chunks emitted before their item
 *   is finalized, lifecycle markers like `response_start`).
