"""E2E for the data contract behind the REPL's live sub-agent display.

The CLI's ``state: N agents running`` badge and ``↓`` sub-agents menu are
fed by two server-side sources, both exercised here against a real LLM:

* the **parent SSE stream** emits ``session.created`` and
  ``session.child_session.updated`` (with ``busy`` / ``current_task_status``)
  for the active session's direct children — the live fast-path; and
* ``GET /v1/sessions/{id}/child_sessions`` lists those children — the source
  the recursive tree poll reads for deeper levels.

If the server stops emitting either, the CLI panel goes blank even while
sub-agents are running. A terminal UI can't be driven from e2e, so this test
asserts the data the panel consumes, not the rendering (covered by the
``tests/frontends/sdk`` unit tests).

Excluded from default ``pytest`` runs via ``--ignore=tests/e2e``. Invoke::

    pytest tests/e2e/test_repl_subagent_panel_events_e2e.py \\
