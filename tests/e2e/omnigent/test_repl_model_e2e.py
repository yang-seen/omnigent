"""E2E: /model command in the real Omnigent REPL under pexpect.

Mirrors :mod:`tests.e2e.omnigent.test_repl_effort_e2e`. Drives
``/model`` against a real ``omnigent run`` REPL spawned with the
test's configured Databricks profile (resolved via the
``databricks_workspace`` fixture from environment) and asserts the
slash-command surface — show / set / show-after-set / reset —
matches the design's contract end-to-end.

    1. Initial ``/model`` echoes ``(agent default)``.

    3. Subsequent ``/model`` echoes the override (i.e. session

    turn (would require model-availability gating beyond what the
