"""Phase 0 characterization test — multi-line input via Ctrl+J.

Drives the REPL under pexpect, types the first half of a
prompt, sends ``Ctrl+J`` to insert a newline mid-input, types the
second half, and finally submits with Enter. Asserts the full
multi-line message reached the agent by looking for BOTH halves
in the rendered ``You>`` banner that the REPL echoes to
scrollback before streaming the assistant response.

**What breaks if this fails:**
- ``omnigent.cli`` removes the ``@kb.add("c-j", ...)`` binding
  that maps Ctrl+J to ``insert_text("\\n")`` — multi-line
  composition is a core REPL affordance.
- ``_format_user_message`` stops preserving interior newlines
  (folds the message into one line), so multi-line input still
  submits but is no longer faithfully echoed.
- The prompt-toolkit submit binding regresses to fire on the
  *first* newline rather than the explicit Enter keypress —
  would truncate the prompt at the Ctrl+J boundary.
