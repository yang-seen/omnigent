"""E2e compaction test for the sessions-native path.

Uses pexpect to run multiple turns within a single ``omnigent run``
session. With ``AP_CONTEXT_WINDOW_OVERRIDE=256`` the compaction budget
(``0.8 * window`` ≈ 204 tokens) is tiny, so proactive compaction fires
after the first verbose turn. The override is a runner-side budget knob
only; it does not cap the harness API call, so the model still produces
full verbose replies that grow the persisted history past the budget.

Boot/turn synchronization and auth go through the shared
``_pexpect_harness`` helpers (the same path every green REPL e2e test
uses):

- ``spawn_omnigent_run`` seeds a TUI theme so the first-run interactive
  theme picker (which blocks on raw keypresses a pexpect child never
  sends) doesn't sit in front of the REPL prompt, and symlinks the
  Databricks auth files into the isolated test HOME so the openai-agents
  harness authenticates (without this it 401s with "Invalid Token" /
  "Credential was not sent" and never produces an assistant turn, so
  history never grows and compaction can't fire).
- ``wait_for_ready`` / ``await_turn_complete`` match the visible ``❯``
  prompt and ``working`` activity line rather than the bottom-toolbar
  ``state: sleeping`` badge, which prompt-toolkit fragments across
  CPR/cursor-move sequences under a PTY (a literal ``sleeping`` substring
  never appears, so a naive wait hangs until the boot timeout).

``OMNIGENT_DATA_DIR`` isolates the runtime data dir (``chat.db`` + the
per-test local server) so the test can inspect the persisted compaction
item without touching the developer's ``~/.omnigent``.
